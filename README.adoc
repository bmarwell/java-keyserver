== Features

=== Multiple key repositories

Unlike typical keyservers, this keyserver supports multiple named "repositories":

* a local keyserver which does not sync, e.g. for company use.
* an outbound-syncing repository (similar to local, but only syncs outbound).
* an inbound-syncing repository (only syncs incoming keys).
  ** type a: sync everything (like most implementations).
  ** type b: sync only requested keys, like Maven repositories do.
  ** Supports exclusion rules to not query specific email domains upstream.
* Groups: Similar to nexus/artifactory, can group repositories for reading.

=== Privacy features

* Will remove keys after a while (configurable).
* Sends mails for verification (local repositories only).
